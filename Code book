30 volunteers performed 6 different activities while wearing a smartphone. 
The smartphone captured various data about their movements.

Explanation of each file
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

Processing steps
All of the relevant data files were read into data frames, appropriate column headers were added, and 
the training and test sets were combined into a single data set.
All feature columns were removed that did not contain the exact string "mean()" or "std()". This left 
66 feature columns, plus the subjectID and activity columns.
The activity column was converted from a integer to a factor, using labels describing the activities.
A tidy data set was created containing the mean of each feature for each subject and each activity.
